# Zeron for iOS

Shipped in this repo as **ZRemote** (`no.hideout.zremote`). The home-screen
icon and sign-in mark are the ZRemote logo. See the repo [README](../../README.md)
and [TestFlight](../../docs/TESTFLIGHT.md).

A UIKit viewport onto the zeron mesh, built on the Rust mobile core. The phone
is a **peer device**: it mirrors the workspace registry, joins per-chat session
rooms, and drives remote engines through the durable command ledger. No agent
runs on the phone.

**Rust decides what to paint and where; Swift paints, scrolls and handles
gestures.** Everything in Rust is platform-neutral — the future Android app
links the same library.

## Build & run

Requires Xcode 26+ and a Rust toolchain with the iOS targets:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
cd apps/ios
xcodebuild -project Zeron.xcodeproj -scheme Zeron \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

The Zeron target's **Rust core** build phase runs `scripts/ios/build-core.sh`,
which builds `crates/mobile` for the active platform (always optimized — the
`mobile` cargo profile) and refreshes the committed UniFFI bindings in
`Zeron/Core/Generated/`. `ZERON_SKIP_CORE=1` reuses the last built library
when iterating on Swift only.

## Layout

```
Zeron/
  App/         AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, AppModel (owns CoreClient; maps
               workspace snapshots to view models; Keychain credentials)
  Core/        Generated UniFFI bindings; Fonts (the exact bytes Rust measures,
               registered with CoreText) + CoreText fallback measurer
  Design/      Palette (Zeron color roles → light/dark), Glass helpers,
               cell-grid status glyph, harness brand marks
  Transcript/  TranscriptListView (virtualized scroll host over LayoutFrame),
               RowView/RowModel (CoreText painter for Rust display lists,
               streaming veil), FrameRelay
  Session/     SessionViewController, SessionSource (Core/Fixture), new-session
               canvas
  Composer/    ComposerBar (glass capsule ⇄ card with inline context chips;
               model picker popover; send/queue/steer/stop), question and queue
               panels, attachments
  Threads/     Sessions (foldable sidebar sections)/folder/search lists,
               cells, new-project folder browser
  Shell/       Tab bar (Sessions, Settings, search; "New session" accessory
               with live summary), sign-in
  Debug/       Transcript lab + hitch meter
```

### Transcript pipeline

1. `zeron-client` applies session-doc updates incrementally (O(changed
   entries)) and publishes immutable snapshots.
2. `TranscriptView.attach(client, chatId)` subscribes **in Rust**; the layout
   thread turns entries into rows (one per markdown block / user message / tool
   group), reparses streaming markdown incrementally, and measures every row
   with `zeron-text` at the viewport width.
3. Each pass publishes a `LayoutFrame`: exact heights + prefix-sum offsets.
   `rowsIn(y0, y1)` is a binary search; `display(i)` builds a display list
   (text runs at exact positions, boxes, links, scrollers, widgets).
4. `TranscriptListView` positions reusable `RowView`s at those offsets and
   paints runs with CoreText at the Rust coordinates — measurement and
   rendering can't disagree. Display models for rows beyond the viewport are
   prefetched off the main thread.

## Launch arguments

| Arg | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-demo` | Offline demo workspace (Rust `DemoHost`: registry, docs, streaming replies) |
| `-fast` / `-longreply` | Demo stream speed / reply length |
| `-big` / `-huge` | Demo transcripts with 120 / 600 turns |
| `-route chat:<id>` / `new` / `more` / `search` | Open a screen at launch |
| `-signedout` | Clear stored credentials |
| `-dev <userId> <orgId> [-edge <url>]` | Dev bearer against an `AUTH_MODE=dev` edge (e.g. `wrangler dev`); not persisted |
| `-harness <id>` | Default harness for new sessions (`mock` for live-stack tests) |
| `-bench` (with `-lab`) | Display-link fling benchmark; writes `Documents/bench.json` |
| `-measureopen` | Session open latency; writes `Documents/open.json` |
| `-lab [-turns N] [-autostream] [-autoscroll] [-top] [-meter]` | Transcript lab over fixture markdown, with an on-screen hitch meter |

## Tests

```sh
# Rust
cargo test -p zeron-text -p zeron-markdown -p zeron-client -p zeron-mobile
cargo test --release -p zeron-mobile --lib bench_layout -- --ignored --nocapture

# Line-break accuracy vs CoreText (same font bytes), flows, hitch benchmarks
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronTests/LineBreakAccuracyTests test
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronUITests/SessionFlowTests test
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronUITests/ScrollPerformanceTests test
```

Live stack (real edge + headless engine; see `ZeronUITests/LiveStackTests.swift`):

```sh
(cd edge && npx wrangler dev --port 27650 --var AUTH_MODE:dev) &
ZERON_DATA_DIR=/tmp/e2e ZERON_IPC_PORT=27811 ZERON_EDGE_URL=http://localhost:27650 \
  ZERON_EDGE_TOKEN=alice@org1 ZERON_ORG_ID=org1 ZERON_HARNESS=mock target/debug/zeron headless &
TEST_RUNNER_ZERON_LIVE_EDGE=http://localhost:27650 xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronUITests/LiveStackTests test
```

The test launches the app with `-harness mock`: a chat's configured harness
wins over the engine's `ZERON_HARNESS` default, so without it a real agent
would run.

## TestFlight release

Run the **iOS TestFlight** workflow (`.github/workflows/ios-testflight.yml`).
It archives this project unsigned, then cloud-signs and uploads with the
ZRemote App Store Connect API key. Bundle id `no.hideout.zremote`. See
[`docs/TESTFLIGHT.md`](../../docs/TESTFLIGHT.md).
